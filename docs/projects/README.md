# TrustBloc Projects

TrustBloc projects are aimed at establishing common standards and development frameworks for next generation digital identity networks. 
Follow [this](https://trustbloc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) documentation for more details about the framework.

Several projects exist today with the goal of creating digital identities that would allow everyday users to have self-governance over the storage, distribution and control of their identity. However many of these solutions are only offered partially and may not integrate well with each other.
TrustBloc provides the end-to-end architecture that enables the deployment of a production-ready digital identity platform.

Follow this document to learn about applications, APIs, services that various TrustBloc projects are offering along with details of open source standards they are following.

Notable open standard ecosystem TrustBloc is following are,

- [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/)
- [W3C](https://www.w3.org/)
- [Hyperledger Aries RFCs](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs)
